# Psychic-Game

Game Play Instructions:

1. Guess what letter I'm thinking of. You will do this by inputting a letter of your choosing on the keyboard.


2. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly). If you enter the correct letter you will gain 1 point per win.


3. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses). If you answer a letter incorrectly a total of 9 times you will gain 1 loss point.


4. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update). After each guess your total of 9 will decrease if it is an incorrect guess.


5. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.) All the letters you guess in a total of 9 will be displayed until the game is reset.


6. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

7. When the player loses, increase the losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

Enjoy The Game!
